# Core Data Handling & Analysis
pandas>=1.3.0
numpy>=1.21.0
python-dateutil>=2.8.2 # For dateutil.relativedelta
datetime>=4.3 # Though datetime is built-in, sometimes a specific package is listed if it's implicitly used
requests>=2.25.1

# Financial Data
yfinance>=0.1.63

# Statistical Modeling
statsmodels>=0.13.0

# Machine Learning (Preprocessing & Evaluation)
scikit-learn>=0.24.2 # sklearn is scikit-learn

# Interactive Visualization
plotly>=5.0.0
# plotly-express is often included with plotly, but explicitly listing it doesn't hurt if issues arise
# plotly-express>=0.4.1

# Technical Analysis
pandas_ta>=0.3.14b0 # As used with pta.sma, pta.rsi, pta.macd
# ta is also imported, but pandas_ta seems to be the primary one used for indicators.
# If `ta` is specifically used for something distinct, uncomment and add:
# ta>=0.10.0

# Web Application Framework
streamlit>=1.0.0

# For NewsAPI (if specific version is needed, otherwise requests covers it)
# This is usually covered by 'requests' but if NewsAPI specific client library is used, list it.
# Based on your code, it's a direct requests call, so no additional specific NewsAPI package needed.

# For caching (handled by streamlit)
# For the implicit date in datetime for the specific version, this is usually covered by default python.
